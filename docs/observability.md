# Observability

How Hilt's logs, metrics and traces reach Grafana, and where its alerts and
dashboards go.

## Logs

Logs are what reaches Grafana today. This service runs in Forge Central, whose
CloudWatch logs and AWS metrics (load balancer, ECS, RDS) ship to Grafana; its
own metrics don't yet
([FIL-1143](https://linear.app/filecoin-foundation/issue/FIL-1143): Instrument
Hilt to provide useful telemetry). Log a failure an operator would act on at
error level, with the context needed to act on it (DIDs and CIDs, never key
material), in a stable message an alert can match.

## Metrics

When a feature's health is best read as a number, such as a failure count, a
queue depth or the time of the last success, say so in the PR description,
naming the metric and
[FIL-1143](https://linear.app/filecoin-foundation/issue/FIL-1143), so it can be
carried to the issue and instrumented when the service exports metrics.

## Traces

Traces don't reach Grafana from Central yet either, but keep the spans complete
for when they do: new work runs inside the request's span, and a new outbound
HTTP client uses `tracing.NewHTTPClient()` (`pkg/tracing`).

## Alerts and dashboards

Alerts and dashboard panels live in fil-forge/infra-central, under
`terraform/envs/grafana/`; its `docs/observability.md` ("Adding an alert or
panel") says how to add them. Open a companion PR there, or say in this PR that
one is needed.
